### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Daniel, and I am an Electronics/Hardware/Embedded Systems Engineer. I also hold a PhD in Materials Science (2D materials) and an MSc in Bioelectronics. I also worked as an Electronics repair technician for nearly 15 years.

I deeply enjoy the ground-up development of mixed-domain instrumentation electronics and embedded systems.

You can check out my Research Output [here](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/daniel.melendrezarmada/publications/)

I worked as a PDRA at the University of Manchester National Graphene Institute (NGI) from 2019 to 2024, developing graphene-based sensors. I was the Lead Engineer of [AtomicMechanicsLtd](https://github.com/Atomic-Mechanics-Ltd) from 2017 to 2024, where we developed graphene-based [pressure sensors](https://atomic-mechanics.com).

From November of 2023 until June of 2024, I developed a series of highly interesting electronic systems for [SmartIR Ltd](https://www.smartir.co.uk), first as an external consultant, then as the Lead Electronics Engineer.

In July on 2024, I took the position of Senior Electronics Engineer at [Graphene Trace Ltd](https://www.graphenetrace.com), where we aim at tackling pressure ulcers using graphene-based pressure sensors and data-driven analysis with the help of advanced ML models. Calling for investors!

In June of 2024, I took a big leap of faith by leaving the UK after 10 years and moving to Thailand, where I founded my consultancy [Ivory Electronics Ltd](www.ivory-electronics.com) and rejoined my lovely wife.

I enjoy CAD design like a madman. Currently using FreeCAD (a bit flawed, but #itsfree!), Onshape (fantastic but $$$) and Fusion 360 (#meh). Learning OpenSCAD.

I am proficient in C/C++, Matlab, Javascript, a bit in C# (getting there) and Python. I use KiCAD daily and therefore, I have been a supporter of their project for the past year or so (and thus I highly encourage you to [donate](https://www.kicad.org/donate/).)

During my free time, you will normally find me in my _mancave_ either designing some random electronic board, coding a C++ library or tinkering with some obscure chip pulled from a PCB that I likely found somewhere in the dumpster.

**Personal Interests**

Apart from Electronics I also do Electronics...#oknobutyes

I do love analog and digital photography. 

I am a confessed coffee snob and have a deep passion for audio gear (you can call me an audiophile, I take no offence :wink:). I also happen to repair audio equipment just for the kicks and giggles.

Happy to collaborate (if my schedule isn't too busy)
