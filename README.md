### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Daniel and I am an Electronics/Hardware/Embedded Systems Engineer. I also hold a PhD in Materials Science (2D materials) and an MSc in Bioelectronics. I also worked as an Electronics repair technician for nearly 15 years.

I deeply enjoy the ground-up developemnt of mixed-domain instrumentation electronics and embedded systems.

You can check out my Research Output [here](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/daniel.melendrezarmada/publications/)

I currently work as a PDRA in The University of Manchester National Graphene Institute (NGI) developing graphene-based sensors. I am the Lead Engineer from [AtomicMechanicsLtd](https://github.com/Atomic-Mechanics-Ltd) where we develop graphene-based [pressure sensors](https://atomic-mechanics.com).

For the past months I have developed a series of highly interesting electronic systems for [SmartIR Ltd](https://www.smartir.co.uk)

On my free time I normally develop Electronics and C++ libraries in my personal _mancave_.

**Personal Interests**

Apart from Electronics I also do Electronics...#oknobutyes

I do love analog and digital photography. 

I am a declared coffee snob and I have a deep passion for audio gear (you can call me audiophile, I take no offence :wink:). I happen to also repair audio equipment just for the kicks and giggles.
