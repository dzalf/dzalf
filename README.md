### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Daniel and I am an Electronics/Hardware/Embedded Systems Engineer. I also hold a PhD in Materials Science (2D materials) and an MSc in Bioelectronics. I also worked as an Electronics repair technician for nearly 15 years.

I deeply enjoy the ground-up developemnt of mixed-domain instrumentation electronics and embedded systems.

You can check out my Research Output [here](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/daniel.melendrezarmada/publications/)

I currently work as a PDRA in The University of Manchester National Graphene Institute (NGI) developing graphene-based sensors. I am the Lead Engineer from [AtomicMechanicsLtd](https://github.com/Atomic-Mechanics-Ltd) where we develop graphene-based [pressure sensors](https://atomic-mechanics.com).

For the past months I have developed a series of highly interesting electronic systems for [SmartIR Ltd](https://www.smartir.co.uk)

I also enjoy CAD design like a madman. Currently using FreeCAD (a bit flawed but #itsfree!), Onshape (fantastic but $$$) and Fusion 360 (#meh). Learning OpenSCAD.

I am proficient in C/C++, Matlab, Javascript, a bit in C# (getting there) and Python. I use KiCAD on a daily basis and therefore I have been a supporter of their project for the past year or so (and thus I highly encourage you to [donate](https://www.kicad.org/donate/) too)

During my free time you will normally find me in my _mancave_ either designing some random electronic board, coding a C++ library or tinkering with some obscure chip pulled from a PCB that I likely found somewhere in the dumpster.

**Personal Interests**

Apart from Electronics I also do Electronics...#oknobutyes

I do love analog and digital photography. 

I am a confessed coffee snob and I have a deep passion for audio gear (you can call me audiophile, I take no offence :wink:). I happen to also repair audio equipment just for the kicks and giggles.

Happy to collaborate (if my schedule isn't too busy)
